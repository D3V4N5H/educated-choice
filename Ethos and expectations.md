1. Sustainability
</summary><p>

The people who commit a crime against the nature, public, or wildlife need to be held accountable. 

We also need to be stakeholders in the commitments that companies make.

For example,

IKEA promised to be Forest positive by 2020.

Companies should strive to be Nokia of their industry, not Facebook.

## Meaning of Sustainability
Avoidance of the depletion of natural resources in order to maintain an ecological balance.

## Context
We need resources used in a considerate way such that we have them left for future generations.
We used up fossil fuels to move on to solar. And now that has material shortage too.
We use and throw gadgets every few years and now there is a chip shortage.

## Motivation
- Excessive consumption causes Environmental damage which can be prevented by durable products and efficient usage of resources.
- Limited natural resources deplete faster than they can be made again.
- Deforestation also harms wildlife and biodiversity

## Expectations

1. We need people who do illegal deforestation to pay for it dearly.
2. We need to educate people about ways to document, report and enforce laws.

2. Safety
</summary><p>

Us as consumers need to establish standards for the companies that provide us.

For example, 

Samsungâ€™s Galaxy Note 7 catching fire could have been prevented before it caused dire ramifications.

We can make a list of companies that have had to make a recall, and share tools and knowledge to validate their claims for assurance of improvement in the future.


## Meaning:
Our scope of safety is 'Consumer Product Safety'.
The products must be safe and meet consumer guarantees under the product safety laws. There should be some safety standards. These standards are designed to ensure the safety of products, activities, or processes etc.

## Motivation
- Criminal organisations have the most to gain from duplicate items. It is the perfect business for them. Our frugality is not to fund them.

## Expectations
1. We need awareness of such practices, and owners of businesses to come in light.
2. We need consumers of these products know of their safety concerns.
