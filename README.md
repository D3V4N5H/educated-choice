# Educated choice
Often we believe sticking with big brands is safe. But when they do things wrong, they do it at scale.

And sometimes the most effective solution to such widespread prevalence is consumers exercising their power of choice to opt for alternative products and services. 

This project is to help everyone share their knowledge, make a case for their preference and get constructive feedback for the sub-optimal choices.
